# Python Bootcamp Project  

This repository contains Python projects developed during a **Data Technician Bootcamp**, focused on building programming fundamentals. The projects demonstrate how Python can be used to build logic, perform calculations, and interact with users through simple scripts.

## üéØ Project Highlights  

- **Variables & Data Types**  
  - Declared and manipulated variables to store user inputs and calculation results.  
  - Applied **type casting** to ensure correct data handling (e.g., converting strings to integers for arithmetic).  

- **User Interaction**  
  - Used the `print()` function to display messages and results.  
  - Collected input with the `input()` function to make scripts interactive.  

- **Control Flow**  
  - Implemented **if statements** to create conditional logic and decision-making.  
  - Designed **for loops** to iterate through sequences and process data.  
  - Utilized **while loops** to repeat tasks until certain conditions were met.  

- **Practical Applications**  
  - Built scripts that perform calculations based on user input.  
  - Created interactive programs that guide users step by step.  
  - Used loops and conditions to automate repetitive tasks.

## üöÄ How to Explore  

1. Browse the `.py` files in this repository to see the projects created.  
2. Open a file in your Python environment (e.g., IDLE, VS Code, Jupyter Notebook).  
3. Run the script and follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the program.
